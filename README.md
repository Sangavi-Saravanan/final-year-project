ABSTRACT
The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to significant challenges in wireless network performance, particularly 
in the realms of throughput, energy consumption, and latency. The IEEE 802.llah standard, also known as Wi-Fi HaLow, is specifically 
tailored for IoT applications due to its extended range and penetration capabilities. However, the standard's performance in dense
IoT environments is often hampered by these challenges. To address this, our project introduces a novel application of Cooperative 
Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access within IEEE 802.11ah networks, aiming to substantially enhance network efficiency and capacity. This 
study focuses on implementing COOPNOMA techniques to improve the throughput and reduce the energy consumption and latency compared to 
the conventional orthogonal methods typically used in such networks. By allowing multiple IoT devices to transmit data simultaneously 
over the same frequency bands without requiring orthogonal resource allocation, COOP-NOMA promises to improve spectral efficiency and
reduce transmission delays key factors in enhancing IoT network performances. Using MATLAB simulations, we rigorously evaluate and analyse 
the performance of IEEE 802.11ah networks incorporating Cooperative NOMA. These results are intended to provide a solid foundation for 
the adoption of Coop-NOMA in future IoT networks, potentially setting a new standard for network design in high-density environments
